# FISC Test

These instructions came with the test:

```
Requires node and npm installed.

1) Download and extract file
2) CD to the "javascript" directory
3) Run "npm install"
4) Run "npm run test" and observe that the tests fail.
5) Open the three source files (fizzbuzz_test, nonunique_test and password_test)
6) Read the instructions at the top of each file carefully
7) Fix the code such that all tests pass, running "npm run test" whenever required to verify progress.

Once all the tests pass or the time limit has been exceeded, zip up the folder and upload to somewhere you can share a link, i.e. drop box, google drive.
```
